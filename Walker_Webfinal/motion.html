    <p>After epic but completely predictable success Matthew refocused his talents into reviving old masterpieces that had already seen their time come and go.  While the world begged him to address various older works he eventually settled on remaking the 1897 masterpiece Dracula.  To address the general populations growing ADHD he decided to shorten and compress the entire story into 10 seconds.  A truly amazing accomplishment that many though was impossible despite the artists unmatched godlike gifts.  However the doubters were quickly swept off their feet by the product.  A true must see unnamed film feature film, recommended to all.  It will likely be appearing in theatres everywhere soon.
