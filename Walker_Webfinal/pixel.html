    <p>Taking the twenty first artist community by storm is Matthew Walker’s first masterpiece “Le Chien Malodorant“.  Wielding a plethora of unmatched raw talent and diamond tipped execution the young prodigy blessed the world with his evocative and lifelike transformation of an ordinary dog.  While the entire world sits contemplating what their dogs might look like if they were actually a lion Matthew got to work carefully crafting the postmodern miracle.  While centered as a political commentary about the dangers and potential of China’s unregulated genetic manipulation research the satirical conception was crafted so flawlessly it is widely considered one of the greatest stand alone pieces to date.  While gazing into the depths of the genius many non-believers claim to have felt god for the first time.
